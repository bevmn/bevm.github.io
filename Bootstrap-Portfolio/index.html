       <h2>About Me</h2>  
            

       <p>I just moved home to Minnesota after being a resident of Nebraska for 30 plus years, and a minor one year stint in Wisconsin. It was exciting to move back as I am orinally from Northfield and hope to have a home there again someday.</p>
       <p>Career experience is heavy in both merchandising and marketing. Analytics and business acumen are also strong abilities that I have garnered throughout the years. Eventually I would like flexibilty to travel about and have more than one residence as I get a bit older and feel that having full stack knowledge and experience will give me that opportunity.</p>
       <p>My career is now my primary focus now that the kids are grown and gone and I am out on my own. The desire is strong to keep it on learning and growing in ways that will not only enrich my career but continue to evolve as a woman. I hope to <i>never</i> retire!</p>
